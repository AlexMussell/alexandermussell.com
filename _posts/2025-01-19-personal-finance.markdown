excerpt: Today I will be discussing the way I manage my personal finances whilst being a resident in the UK.

The UK has A LOT of tax laws, and it can be a minefield to navigate. It's complicated (seemingly on purpose) and it has 
taken me a lot of time to work out a decent approach to managing my own finances. I am by no means a financial advisor, however
this is how I am going about reducing my tax burden, and maximising my savings. I will not be discussing stock picks and allocation.
Just the different saving vehicles that I will take advantage of.

### Stocks and Shares ISA

The Stocks and Shares ISA is a tax-efficient way to invest your money. You can invest up to £20,000 per year (for now...), and you do not
pay tax on any capital gains or dividends. This is a great way to invest in the stock market, and you can choose from a wide
range of investments. Step 1 for me is to max this out every year. I am currently using Trading212 as my provider as I have
full flexibility on what I can invest in, and the fees are low - and unlike a lot of providers, you are also allowed to take money 
out of your ISA without losing your allowance for the year.

As I am already a house owner, I do not have a Lifetime ISA (I did, but I have closed it now). However, if you don't own a house, and are under 40, this is a great
way to save for a house as you get a 25% bonus on your savings up to £4,000 per year. This will come off of your ISA limit, however.
So if you save 4k into your LISA, you can only save 16k into your S&S ISA.

### SIPP

This is where things get a little tricky. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer (£50k–£150k), you may fall into the effective 60%
tax bracket between £100,000 and £125,140. How can you minimize this? One of the best strategies is to use a Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). 
A SIPP allows you to contribute to your pension while the government effectively “tops up” your contributions by giving you tax 
relief on the amount you would have paid in tax. You can contribute up to £60,000 per year, including any contributions from your employer.

But how does this work? First, you’ll need a SIPP. Currently, I use Nutmeg, but I’m considering switching to Vanguard 
because they have lower fees (although they tend to invest more heavily in bonds, which doesn’t suit my risk profile). 
Once I’ve maxed out my Stocks and Shares ISA limit, I save any additional money in a high-interest savings account. 
This provides extra liquidity should I need it during the year.

Then, as the tax year ends (on April 5th), I transfer my savings into my SIPP. After that, I fill out a Self-Assessment tax 
return to claim the additional higher-rate tax relief. This is a fantastic way to save for retirement while reducing your tax burden.

Once I receive my tax rebate, I have a few options. I can:
* Use the rebate to top up my SIPP again, which will also qualify for additional tax relief.
* Invest the rebate into my Stocks and Shares ISA as a head start for the new tax year.
* Pay down any outstanding debt - credit cards etc.
  * NOTE: I don’t have any debt outside direct debits to pay off my AMEX (I love cashback!), but if you do, this is a great way to reduce your interest payments.
* Or, contribute to a savings account to take advantage of the Personal Savings Allowance (£500 for higher-rate taxpayers, £1,000 for basic-rate taxpayers).

Personally I like the idea of front loading my ISA with my rebate, so I have more time in the market and greater liquidity. It then means I
 will pay off my ISA faster than the previous year, so I can then deposit a larger amount into my SIPP the following year.
