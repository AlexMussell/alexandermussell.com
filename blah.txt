Need a quick hand:

currently seeting up a blog/cv/reading list thing to track progress of shit i do.
As it is just to track progress, im using jekyll which plain text into static websites. so you create posts via markdown in github

Got an issue with the Ruby templating language, its pretty much jinja.

In the reading list i currently have to manually add items eg

<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Good-Evil-Friedrich-Nietzsche/dp/1497415764"><img src="{{ "/assets/reading-list/beyond-good-and-evil.jpg" | relative_url }}" alt="Beyond Good and Evil"></a>

However, what I want to be able to do is in my _config.yml to set some vars:

reading_list:
    beyond-good-and-evil: <amazonurl>

and do something like so

{% for book in site.template.reading_list %}
    <a href="{{ book[1] }}" src="{{ "assets/reading-list/{{ book[0] }}.jpg" }}">
{% endfor %}

However, nested vars arent allowed so i have tried numerous other things.

You get my drift. Any ideas on anything? If it has to be done manually thats fine as I wont have to do it often
