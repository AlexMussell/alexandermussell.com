      <p>Hi! I’m Alex. I’ve spent my career creating, automating, and supporting multi-environment platforms, infrastructure,
        and services at global scale—primarily in enterprise digital streaming across both public and private clouds.

        When I’m not working, you can usually find me thru-hiking, at the gym, or enjoying life with my spouse.
        I’m always excited to connect and share ideas, so feel free to reach out!

            Working in the Cloud Engineering Platform team we worked on administering AWS and GCP networking and accounts
            on a global scale, covering multi-region (USA, SA, EU), multi-proposition (Peacock, Showtime, ShowMax), and multi organisation.
            We managed all the governance, in such a way to be audit compliant. Used terraform/terragrunt
            and internal tooling to manage this huge estate. Due to the size of the estate, our biggest
            limitations were the limitations of terraform, hence why we needed bespoke internal
            tooling We provided all the necessary access required to AWS services and provide them
            as a service to customers including but not limited to; AWS Config, Guardduty, S3,
            Cloudtrail Most recent project was migrating our PR automation, Atlantis, as to be PCI
            compliant. I had to deal with auditors, principals, and senior management to get the
            completed on time.
